# Projects and Professional Development

## Home Lab Projects

As an enthusiastic IT learner, I constantly challenge myself to enhance my skills through hands-on experience and home lab projects. 
Top projects i've worked on or currently working on: 

 Malware Analysis Lab: https://github.com/alubin03/Malware_Anaysis_Lab#malware-analysis-lab

 Active Directory Lab: https://github.com/alubin03/AD#active-directory-lab

## Self Study Cirriculum 

I’ve created a self study curriculum that includes identifying areas where I want to improve my skills and knowledge, setting specific and measurable goals, and creating a timeline for achieving those goals.

Throughout the process, I will regularly reflect on my progress, adjust my plan as needed, and share my insights and observations through blog posts and other documentation. By doing so, I hope to demonstrate my commitment to personal and professional growth!🌱
