# Projects and Professional Development

## Home Lab Projects

As an enthusiastic IT learner, I constantly challenge myself to enhance my skills through hands-on experience and home lab projects. Through my focus on Active Directory, vulnerability assessments and other projects, I am consistently building upon my technology skills and gaining practical knowledge in the field. My dedication to continuous improvement enables me to learn new things every day. 

Top projects i've worked on or currently working on:

## Self Study Plan/Cirriculum 

I’ve created a self study planner/curriculum that includes identifying areas where I want to improve my skills and knowledge, setting specific and measurable goals, and creating a timeline for achieving those goals.

Throughout the process, I will regularly reflect on my progress, adjust my plan as needed, and share my insights and observations through blog posts and other documentation. By doing so, I hope to demonstrate my commitment to personal and professional growth!🌱
